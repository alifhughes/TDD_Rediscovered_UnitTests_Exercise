# TDD Rediscovered-Exercise

## The Exercise

### The Bowling Game Kata

Inspired by [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/acsbowling/)



## The Rules

The purpose of this kata is to experience the unit testing approach whilst using the following rules:

* We are writing Unit Tests. The Unit is a class and should be isolated from other classes.

* The prompt to write a test is a new method. If we need a method, we write a test before we write the method.

* When we discover that we need collaborators our preference is to mock them, establishing their behaviour from the client, and then implement them with their own tests.
